name: seo-ecommerce
description: Dispatched leaf for e-commerce SEO — audits product/category on-page signals, validates Product schema for merchant eligibility, and checks image and faceted/canonical strategy on a store URL, returning per-product findings and schema validation. Fanned out by the SEO audit orchestrator as a CONDITIONAL specialist when the site is a store (cart/checkout/Product schema detected); wraps the seo-ecommerce skill method with no forked logic.

# seo-ecommerce  (dispatched-leaf agent)

<!-- Conditional dispatch specialist that EXISTS as a sibling skill — a valid leaf.
     It wraps skills/seo-ecommerce/SKILL.md exactly: same Tier cascade, same free
     path, same outputs. No forked or "improved" logic. -->
<!-- DAG: orchestrator -> this agent -> schema_gen.py, one direction. This leaf
     dispatches nothing (no Task tool) and never names its orchestrator as a
     dependency. seo-schema / seo-page / seo-image-audit / seo-programmatic are
     prose cross-references, not edges. -->
<!-- Least privilege (C5): Bash runs the bundled validators (schema_gen.py for
     Product schema; the script-backed on-page/product checks). The scripts do the
     work, so no WebFetch/WebSearch is granted (a fetch tool + Bash together is a
     hard failure). Read/Glob/Grep inspect local product HTML and feed files. The
     method returns the Output-contract block in context -- it writes no file, so
     Write is NOT granted. Nothing else. -->

**Wraps:** `skills/seo-ecommerce/SKILL.md` — same method, no forked logic.

## Method

E-commerce-specific SEO on a store: audit product and category on-page signals
(unique benefit-led titles/descriptions, one h1, descriptive URL, internal links,
real review content), validate Product schema for merchant eligibility, and check
image SEO and faceted/canonical strategy for filters and variants. Deep schema goes
to `seo-schema`, per-product depth to `seo-page`, image depth to `seo-image-audit`,
and facet consolidation to `seo-programmatic` (prose cross-references — not calls).

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/seo/schema_gen.py" --validate product.json   # Product-schema eligibility
```

Require `name` + `image`; for merchant eligibility include `offers` with `price` +
`priceCurrency` + `availability`. Include `aggregateRating`/`review` **only when
real** — never fabricate ratings or reviews into schema (it is a manual-action
risk). Google Shopping presence, Amazon marketplace visibility, and competitor
pricing are the DataForSEO-Merchant path; when it is not connected, audit feed
basics and on-page signals manually, emit a `needs_tier1` note, and never synthesize
a marketplace or pricing number.

## Capability routing

This agent obeys the plugin's capability-tier cascade
(`references/CAPABILITY-TIERS.md`), identical to the `seo-ecommerce` skill it wraps.
It adapts to what's available and never fails — the built-in Tier 2 is the product.

1. **Tier 1 — DataForSEO Merchant.** If DataForSEO is connected
   (`DATAFORSEO_USERNAME` / `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD`), pull Google Shopping presence,
   Amazon/keyword-gap data, and competitor pricing.
2. **Tier 2 — built-in (the default).** Otherwise run `schema_gen.py --validate` for
   Product-schema eligibility and audit product/category on-page, image, and
   faceted/canonical signals. A complete on-page e-commerce audit, zero spend.
3. **Tier 3 — n/a.** No local CLI deepens this capability (`none`).
4. **Tier 4 — guided.** Offline? Validate local Product JSON with `schema_gen.py`,
   check feed basics manually, and name what DataForSEO Merchant would add
   (marketplace presence + pricing).

End by stating which tier ran and what a higher tier would add. Marketplace
presence, pricing, and ratings are never fabricated — emit the on-page audit + the
`needs_tier1` note instead.

```capability-routing
capability:   schema
tier1:        DataForSEO Merchant (Google Shopping + Amazon marketplace intelligence)
tier1_signal: DATAFORSEO_USERNAME | DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD
tier2:        scripts/seo/schema_gen.py --validate (Product-schema eligibility) + on-page product/category/image/faceted audit
tier2_yields: per-product on-page scores + Product schema validation + prioritized fixes, zero spend
tier3:        none
tier3_signal: none
tier4:        validate local Product JSON with schema_gen.py + manual feed-basics check; add DataForSEO Merchant for Shopping/Amazon
needs_tier1:  Google Shopping presence, Amazon marketplace visibility, competitor pricing, aggregate rating / review counts
```

## Output contract

The agent returns exactly this block so the SEO audit orchestrator can fan-in many
specialist leaves deterministically (one `key: value` per line; complex values are
inline JSON):

```output-contract
agent:        seo-ecommerce
status:       ok | partial | error
tier_ran:     1 | 2 | 4
target:       <store domain or product URL(s) audited>
findings:     <JSON array of {area, severity, finding, fix}; area in product-on-page|product-schema|images|faceted-canonical|marketplace; severity in critical|high|medium|info>
score:        null
needs_tier1:  Google Shopping presence, Amazon marketplace visibility, competitor pricing, aggregate rating / review counts | none
handoffs:     seo-schema (deep Product schema), seo-page (per-product), seo-image-audit (images), seo-programmatic (facets) | none
tier_line:    <one sentence: which tier ran + what a higher tier would add>
```
