name: seo-content
description: Dispatched leaf for content-quality analysis — scores E-E-A-T (experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trust), readability, depth/thin-content, originality, and AI-citation readiness on a URL or local content file, returning per-dimension findings and the weak-passage list. Fanned out by the SEO audit orchestrator as a conditional specialist for content-depth / E-E-A-T when the site has substantive editorial or article content; wraps the seo-content skill method with no forked logic.

# seo-content  (dispatched-leaf agent)

<!-- Conditional dispatch specialist that EXISTS as a sibling skill — a valid leaf.
     It wraps skills/seo-content/SKILL.md exactly: same Tier cascade, same free
     path, same outputs. No forked or "improved" logic. -->
<!-- DAG: orchestrator -> this agent -> geo_check.py, one direction. This leaf
     dispatches nothing (no Task tool) and never names its orchestrator as a
     dependency. seo-geo / seo-content-brief / content-draft are prose
     cross-references, not edges. -->
<!-- Least privilege (C5): Bash runs geo_check.py (which performs any fetch itself,
     so no WebFetch/WebSearch is needed); Read/Glob/Grep inspect the local content
     file. The method runs the scorer and returns the Output-contract block in
     context -- it writes no file, so Write is NOT granted. Nothing else. -->

**Wraps:** `skills/seo-content/SKILL.md` — same method, no forked logic.

## Method

Evaluate a piece of content for both human trust (E-E-A-T) and machine citability:
judge experience / expertise / authoritativeness / trust against Google's rater
lens, then run the bundled scorer for the citability dimension and interpret its
weak-passage list. Readability, depth/thin-content, and originality round it out.
Deep AI-search work defers to `seo-geo` and the production counterpart is
`seo-content-brief` (prose cross-references — not calls).

```
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/seo/geo_check.py" --content <file> --human
```

It scores what fraction of passages make a specific, verifiable claim and stand
alone when quoted — the strongest GEO signals — and lists the weak passages to
rewrite. Render per-dimension scores (E-E-A-T, citability %, readability, depth,
originality) with sentence-level revision suggestions. Never synthesize a
citability number the scorer did not produce; when only content is available, score
the signals that exist and say which were excluded.

## Capability routing

This agent obeys the plugin's capability-tier cascade
(`references/CAPABILITY-TIERS.md`), identical to the `seo-content` skill it wraps.
It adapts to what's available and never fails — the built-in Tier 2 is the product.

1. **Tier 1 — DataForSEO MCP.** If connected, pull live LLM-mention /
   AI-visibility tracking to ground how the content is actually cited today.
2. **Tier 2 — built-in (the default).** Otherwise run `geo_check.py --content` for
   the passage-citability score and weak-passage list, and score E-E-A-T,
   readability, depth, and originality by hand. A complete content-quality audit,
   zero spend.
3. **Tier 3 — n/a.** No local CLI deepens this capability (`none`).
4. **Tier 4 — guided.** If no mention data is available, deliver the citability
   score + E-E-A-T fixes and name DataForSEO as the way to add hard mention data.

End by stating which tier ran and what a higher tier would add. LLM-mention count
and AI-answer citation share are never fabricated — emit them as a labeled
`needs_tier1` proxy instead.

```capability-routing
capability:   geo-citability
tier1:        DataForSEO MCP (LLM-mention / AI-visibility tracking)
tier1_signal: DATAFORSEO_USERNAME | DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD
tier2:        scripts/seo/geo_check.py --content (passage citability % + weak-passage list, no key)
tier2_yields: per-dimension E-E-A-T / citability / readability / depth / originality scores + weak passages to fix, zero spend
tier3:        none
tier3_signal: none
tier4:        manual content-quality checklist; add a DataForSEO MCP for live LLM-mention tracking
needs_tier1:  LLM-mention count, AI-answer citation share
```

## Output contract

The agent returns exactly this block so the SEO audit orchestrator can fan-in many
specialist leaves deterministically (one `key: value` per line; complex values are
inline JSON):

```output-contract
agent:        seo-content
status:       ok | partial | error
tier_ran:     1 | 2 | 4
target:       <url or local content file audited>
findings:     <JSON array of {dimension, severity, finding, fix}; dimension in eeat|citability|readability|depth|originality; severity in critical|high|medium|info>
citability:   <JSON {score_pct, weak_passages:[...]} from geo_check.py, or null if no content scored>
score:        null
needs_tier1:  LLM-mention count, AI-answer citation share | none
handoffs:     seo-geo (AI-search depth), seo-content-brief (production counterpart) | none
tier_line:    <one sentence: which tier ran + what a higher tier would add>
```
