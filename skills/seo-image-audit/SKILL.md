name: seo-image-audit
description: Audit a page's images for SEO and performance — alt text, file size, modern formats (WebP/AVIF), responsive srcset, lazy loading, and CLS-safe dimensions, plus ready-to-run conversion commands. Uses DataForSEO for live image-SERP rankings when connected; otherwise audits from page fetch and parsing alone. Trigger when the user says "image seo", "image audit", "alt text", "image optimization", "convert to webp", "convert to avif", or "image performance".

# seo-image-audit

**Family:** seo
**Status:** Stable

## Purpose

The audit half of image SEO (split from generation because the two have different
legal, asset, and API risk). Inventories a page's images and scores each on the
dimensions that affect search and performance. The free path (fetch + parse) is
the whole product; DataForSEO only adds live image-SERP context.

## Triggers

- "image seo" / "image audit" / "image optimization"
- "alt text" / "image metadata"
- "convert to webp" / "convert to avif"
- "image rankings" / "google images"

## Inputs

- Page URL or local HTML/build path (or an image directory)
- Optional: target keyword(s) for alt-text relevance

## Steps

1. **Inventory images** — fetch the page (or scan the directory) and list every
   image with its `src`, dimensions, format, and file size.
2. **Score each image:**
   - **Alt text** — present? descriptive? keyword-relevant without stuffing?
     (decorative images should have empty `alt=""`).
   - **Format** — modern (WebP/AVIF) vs legacy (JPEG/PNG); flag conversion wins.
   - **File size / dimensions** — oversized for display size? recommend target.
   - **Responsive** — `srcset`/`sizes`/`<picture>` present where useful?
   - **Lazy loading** — `loading="lazy"` below the fold; eager for the LCP image.
   - **CLS** — width/height or aspect-ratio declared to reserve space?
3. **Optional enrichment** — if the DataForSEO extension is configured, add image
   SERP rankings; otherwise state, in one line, what it would add.
4. **Render findings** grouped Critical / High / Medium / Low, each with a concrete
   fix and (for format/size) the recommended target. For "convert to webp/avif"
   requests, output ready-to-run conversion commands per image (`cwebp`, ImageMagick
   `magick`, or a Sharp snippet) as the actionable deliverable — running them needs
   that tool installed (see Notes).

## Outputs

- Per-image findings table with prioritized fixes
- A summary of the biggest performance wins (format + size)
- A short "what paid data would add" note on the free path

## Dependencies

- None required — the free path uses page fetch + parsing
- Optional: DataForSEO extension (image SERP); `seo-page` (page-level context)

## Notes

Pairs with `seo-image-gen` (the generation half). Actual file conversion
(WebP/AVIF) and metadata injection require Sharp/ImageMagick if you want the skill
to perform the conversion rather than recommend it.
