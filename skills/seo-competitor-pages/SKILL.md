# seo-competitor-pages

**Family:** seo
**Status:** Stable

## Purpose

Generate the comparison and alternatives content types — bottom-of-funnel,
high-intent, often high-CTR pages that frequently outrank top-of-funnel content for
buyer-intent queries. Produces the page, its feature matrix, validated schema, and a
conversion-optimized layout.

## Triggers

- "comparison page" / "vs page" / "X vs Y" / "versus"
- "alternatives page" / "alternative to"
- "compare competitors" / "competitor comparison"

## Inputs

- Target product/service and the competitor(s) (user-named, or from provided pages)
- Page type: comparison ("X vs Y") | alternatives ("alternatives to X")
- Brand positioning / the honest angle you win on

## Steps

1. **Gather facts.** Use competitor pages the user provides (or `design-research`
   when available) to extract real feature/pricing data — never invent competitor
   facts (legal + trust risk).
2. **Build the matrix.** Score both sides on the criteria buyers actually weigh; be
   fair (one-sided hit pieces lose trust and links).
3. **Draft the page** (hand copy to `copywriting`): decisive H1, an at-a-glance
   verdict, the feature matrix, use-case fit ("choose X if…, choose Y if…"), and an
   FAQ section.
4. **Add schema** via `seo-schema`: Product/SoftwareApplication, Review/
   AggregateRating (only with real ratings), and BreadcrumbList. Note: FAQ markup is
   still valid for AI/semantic context but **no longer yields a Google rich result**
   (deprecated 2026-05-07) — don't promise an FAQ snippet.
5. **Conversion layer.** One primary CTA, decision-aid widget, trust signals near
   the verdict (apply `design-cro`).
6. **Render** the page (HTML/markdown) + the matrix data + embedded schema.

## Outputs

- Generated comparison/alternatives page (HTML or markdown)
- Feature-matrix data + validated JSON-LD
- Conversion-optimized layout notes

## Dependencies

- `seo-schema` (schema generation/validation); `copywriting` (page copy);
  `design-cro` (conversion). Optional: `design-research` (competitor facts).

## Notes

Accuracy and fairness are the differentiator and the legal guardrail — only publish
competitor claims you can substantiate.
