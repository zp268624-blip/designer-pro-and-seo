"""
verify_release.py — the single release gate for the designer-pro-and-seo plugin.

Aggregates the checks that keep the published plugin honest and consistent, and
exits non-zero on any failure so CI (and a pre-publish run) can block a bad release.
Standard library only. ASCII-only output (safe on a Windows cp1252 console).

Checks:
  1. smoke    — scripts/smoke_test.py passes; docs cite the current smoke count
  2. refs     — every scripts/...py path named in a SKILL.md exists; no singular
                "extension/" path typo
  3. prov     — every shipped script has a record in references/PROVENANCE.md
  4. clean    — no name from a local .clean-room-denylist appears in any shipped file
  5. config   — no @latest in any .mcp.json; plugin.json homepage/repository set and
                license non-placeholder + consistent with the LICENSE file
  6. counts   — SHIPPING + README skill counts match the filesystem; README states
                the real script count
  7. version  — README/SHIPPING/RELEASE-NOTES reference the current version; no stale
                version pointer remains in any skill
  8. paths    — skills invoke bundled scripts via ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}, not a bare
                'python scripts/...' path (which breaks once the plugin is installed)
  9. market   — .claude-plugin/marketplace.json exists, has a plugin with a source,
                and its version matches plugin.json (so the repo installs as a marketplace)

  Wave-0 clean-room / governance guards (see MASTER-PLAN sections 7.3, 7.4):
  C7 cleanroom — fail-closed clean-room guard. The GENERIC family (open-license
                attribution markers, the reserved brand token, and source-attribution
                headers of any scheme) is hardcoded and runs UNCONDITIONALLY whether or
                not the gitignored .cleanroom-thirdparty exists -- so it still fires on
                public CI where the file is absent. Only the NAME portion is best-effort:
                a missing file vacuously passes the NAME denylist (mirrors _load_denylist),
                a present-but-unreadable file is a loud FAIL. Marker / brand / source
                literals are assembled from fragments so this guard's own source never
                self-flags. NAMES (the denylist literals, plus a copyright-sign+name
                pattern) are scanned on RAW text with NO whole-file exemption -- a
                third-party name may never appear in ANY shipped file. The generic
                marker / brand / source family is exempt only in the four governance /
                attribution docs (references/PROVENANCE.md, references/NOTICE.md, the root
                NOTICE.md, references/ENGINE-CONTRACTS.md). tests/ is pruned. A span-aware
                owner-tool allowlist exempts a denylisted substring only where it sits
                inside an allowlisted token, never a standalone leak. The brand token
                matches the all-caps form as a whole word (and the title-case form only in
                "<brand> framework" context), never the bare lowercase form (which collides
                with workflow / overflow / data-flow).
  C9 sync/lock — no sync_* prompt-fetcher script anywhere; no *-prompts.lock file.
  C8 prov      — every per-class asset section exists in PROVENANCE; every
                references/shared/*.md + AGENTS.md has a row; high-risk rows carry a
                clean-room method note. Widened: EVERY references/**/*.md CITED by a
                SKILL.md (per-skill references included, extracted the C1 way) is a
                high-risk class -> must have a first-cell-anchored backtick PROVENANCE
                row AND a method note (a per-skill reference can no longer ship unrecorded).
  C1 skillrefs — every references/*.md path cited inside a SKILL.md resolves on disk.
  C-HANDOFF    — the three named handoffs hold on the current tree (qa-gate->seo-page
                and design-research->seo-cluster stay orchestrator Dependencies;
                seo-drift <-> design-visual-qa stay a Notes-level mutual reference and
                never a Dependencies edge).
  C-COUNT      — no NEW data/*.csv row count within +/-2 of a recorded inspiration
                count, nor a column-set near-match (record-only until CSVs land).
  C11 stdlib   — scripts/** import only the stdlib allowlist (+ local siblings).

  Wave-2 scaffold guards (agents/ layer + connector Tier-2; see MASTER-PLAN 7.4 / 8-W2):
  C5 agentpriv -- every agents/*.md (the _-prefixed template is excluded) declares the
                required frontmatter keys (name/description/model/maxTurns/tools) and is
                LEAST-PRIVILEGE: a fetch-only agent (holds WebFetch/WebSearch) may not
                also hold Bash, and no agent may grant a tool outside the leaf primitive
                set (so Task -- the dispatch power -- and any other high-privilege tool fail).
  C3 agentwf   -- every agent is well-formed: the '## Capability routing' section holds a
                ```capability-routing block carrying every fixed CAPABILITY-TIERS key, and
                the '## Output contract' section holds a non-empty machine-parseable
                ```output-contract block with its fixed keys -- a heading with no fenced
                block, or a block missing a required key, FAILS (no vacuous heading-only
                pass). It also names NO orchestrator as a Dependencies entry and calls NO
                other agent (no Task tool, no agents/<other>.md ref) -- a one-directional
                orchestrator->agent->script DAG. Plus a dispatch-shape guard: a fenced
                ```dispatch block (in any orchestrator SKILL.md or references/dispatch-
                matrix.md) that splits its specialists 8-always + 7-conditional FAILS
                (do-not-mirror a third-party roster). Plus name<->file<->sibling parity:
                every agents/<name>.md has frontmatter name==<name> and a sibling
                skills/<name>/SKILL.md (orphan agent or name mismatch FAILS). Orchestrator
                dispatch==disk parity is deferred to W4 (not enforced here).
  C4 tier2     -- every skill that embeds a machine-parseable ```capability-routing block
                declares a non-empty tier2 that NAMES A SCRIPT RESOLVING ON DISK (reuses
                the check_refs/_exists resolver, extended to bare basenames) AND has a
                golden example under references/examples/<skill>/ that exercises EVERY such
                script with an actual runnable COMMAND (the script basename followed by an
                argument / line-continuation) -- a bare prose mention no longer counts. A
                block carrying 'c4_exempt: true' (and seo-image-gen) is exempt.
